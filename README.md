# ThesisMM

In light of open science principles and to promote transparency and reproducibility, I have made the code used for my master thesis in Marketing Management at Tilburg University publicly available. The code can be accessed on [GitHub](https://github.com/NielsRahder/ThesisMM) and includes the scripts and analyses conducted in the study.

Furthermore, as part of my commitment to data privacy and protection, the first 10 rows of the anonymized dataset have been added to the repository, the rest of the anonimized data is available upon request.
