# ThesisMM

In light of open science principles and to promote transparency and reproducibility, I have made the code used for my master thesis in Marketing Management at Tilburg University publicly available. The code can be accessed on [GitHub](https://github.com/NielsRahder/ThesisMM) and includes the scripts and analyses conducted in the study.

Furthermore, as part of my commitment to data privacy and protection, the data has not been added to this respository. The full anaonymized dataset is available upon request.  

## Running the code

R and R studio installation guide [Installation Guide](https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/configure-your-computer/statistics-and-computation/r/)

Clone the repository to your device using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ThesisMM.git`\
Set working directory to the structure of your directory by using the `setwd()` function in R Studio\
Before running the full analysis first the following two source code files (located in the src folder) need to be run: 

1) `Clean.R` 
2) `pretest.R`

Following this the rest of the code in the folder can be run!
