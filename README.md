# ThesisMM

In light of open science principles and to promote transparency and reproducibility, I have made the code used for my master thesis in Marketing Management at Tilburg University publicly available. The code can be accessed on [GitHub](https://github.com/NielsRahder/ThesisMM) and includes the scripts and analyses conducted in the study.

Furthermore, as part of my commitment to data privacy and protection, the first 10 rows of the anonymized dataset have been added to the repository, the rest of the anonymized data from the pretest and the main analysis is available upon request.  

## Running the code

R and R studio installation guide https://tilburgsciencehub.com/building-blocks/configure-your-computer/statistics-and-computation/r/
Clone the repository to your device
Set working directory to the structure of your directory by using the setwd() function in R Studio
Before running the full analysis first the following two source code files (located in the src folder) need to be run: 

1. Clean.R 
2. pretest.R

Following this the rest of the code in the folder can be run.
